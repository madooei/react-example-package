# React Example Package

A minimal React TypeScript package template for creating reusable React components that can be used both locally and published to NPM.

> [!TIP]

- Provides TypeScript type definitions
- React as peer dependency (not bundled)
- ESLint with React and React Hooks rules
- Prettier for code formatting
- Vitest with React Testing Library for component testing
- Tailwind CSS classes for styling (bring your own Tailwind)
- Minimal dependencies
- Can be used locally or published to NPM

- `npm run dev` - Run in development mode with watch
- `npm start` - Run the package
- `npm run debug` - Run with debugger attached
- `npm test` - Run tests
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage
- `npm run test:ui` - Run tests with UI
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run lint:fix` - Fix ESLint errors
- `npm run format` - Check code formatting
- `npm run format:fix` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run validate` - Run all checks (types, lint, format, tests)
- `npm run clean` - Clean the package (remove dist and coverage)
- `npm run clean:all` - Clean the package and all dependencies (remove dist, coverage, and node_modules)
- `npm run release` - Create a new release (bump version, update changelog, create tag)

## Release & Publish Workflow

### Automated Versioning and Changelog

This package uses [`standard-version`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) to automate versioning and changelog updates. To create a new release:

1. Make sure all your changes are committed.

2. Run:

   ```bash
   npm run release
   ```

   This will:

   - Bump the version in `package.json` according to your commit messages (using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)).
   - Update `CHANGELOG.md` with a summary of changes.
   - Create a new Git tag for the release.

3. Push your changes and tags:

   ```bash
   git push && git push --tags
   ```

### Publishing to NPM via GitHub Actions

This repository is set up to publish the package to NPM automatically using GitHub Actions:

- **When does it publish?**

  - When you create a new GitHub Release (from the GitHub UI or by pushing a tag and creating a release), or
  - When you manually trigger the workflow from the GitHub Actions tab.

- **What does it do?**
  - Installs dependencies, runs all validation (type-check, lint, format, tests), builds the package, and publishes to NPM if all checks pass.

> [!NOTE]
> You must add your NPM token as a secret named `NPM_TOKEN` in your GitHub repository settings for publishing to work.

### Publishing to NPM Manually

Make sure you have a NPM account and are logged in (you can use `npm login` to do this). Then, in this directory, follow these steps:

1. Build the package:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Publish to NPM:

   ```bash
   npm publish
   ```

Now anyone can install the package from NPM:

```bash
npm install @madooei/react-example-package
```

## Package Name and Scope

This package uses the npm scope `@madooei` which is my personal npm account. When using this template for your own package:

1. Change the package name in `package.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "@your-scope/your-package-name"
   }
   ```

2. To publish a scoped package:
   - Create an npm account if you haven't already
   - Create your scope (can be your npm username)
   - When first publishing: `npm publish --access public`

> [!NOTE]
> Private scoped packages require a paid npm account. Public scoped packages are free but must be explicitly published with `--access public`.
