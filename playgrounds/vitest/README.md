# Vitest Playground

This is an typescript playground to experiment with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/), a Vite-native unit testing framework.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

## Run the Tests

```bash
npm run test            # Run tests once
npm run test:watch      # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage   # Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:ui         # Run tests with UI
``` 

To see the coverage report, open the `coverage/index.html` file in your browser after running the tests with coverage.
