# Roadmap for React Example Package Workspace

This document outlines the roadmap for the React Example Package Workspace, detailing its current status, future plans, and key decisions made during development.

## Project Overview

The React Example Package Workspace provides a comprehensive template for building and publishing React component libraries. It demonstrates best practices for TypeScript React component development, tree-shaking optimization, peer dependency management, and multi-framework build systems.

## Current Status

### What's Complete ‚úÖ

- **React Component Architecture**: Complete Button and Card components with TypeScript props
- **Tree-Shaking Optimization**: Individual exports for optimal bundle sizes
- **Peer Dependencies**: Proper React, React-DOM, and Tailwind CSS peer dependency setup
- **Build System**: tsup configuration for ESM/CJS dual builds with React JSX support
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest with React Testing Library and jsdom environment
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type definitions with React component interfaces
- **Styling Integration**: Tailwind CSS integration with component library scanning
- **Development Tooling**: Complete toolchain (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript)
- **Example Applications**: Working examples with Tailwind 3 and Tailwind 4 setups
- **Documentation System**: Comprehensive usage guides and integration examples

### In Progress üöß

- **Component Library Expansion**: Additional commonly-used React components
- **Storybook Integration**: Component documentation and visual testing

### Next Steps

- **Accessibility Features**: ARIA support and keyboard navigation
- **Theme System**: Dynamic theming beyond Tailwind classes
- **Component Composition**: Advanced component patterns and render props

## Project Evolution

### Key Decisions Made

- **React Focus**: Specialized for React component libraries vs generic TypeScript packages
- **Tailwind Integration**: Built-in Tailwind CSS support for rapid styling
- **Tree-Shaking First**: Individual component exports to minimize bundle impact
- **Peer Dependencies**: React as peer dependency to avoid version conflicts
- **JSX Preservation**: Build system preserves JSX for framework flexibility
- **Runtime Validation**: Peer dependency checks to provide helpful error messages

### Learnings and Insights

- **Bundle Optimization**: Tree-shaking requires careful export structure design
- **Peer Dependencies**: Essential for React libraries to prevent version mismatches
- **Build Complexity**: React components need different build configuration than vanilla TS
- **Testing Requirements**: React components need specialized testing setup
- **Styling Strategy**: Component libraries need consistent styling approach

### Recent Changes

- Migrated from standard-version to release-it for better GitHub integration
- Added comprehensive peer dependency validation with runtime checks
- Enhanced tree-shaking with individual component exports
- Improved TypeScript configuration for React component development
- Added Tailwind CSS v4 support alongside v3 examples
- Implemented proper React Testing Library setup with jsdom

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

**Button Component** (`src/components/button.tsx`)

- Variant system (primary, secondary, danger)
- Size system (small, medium, large)
- Disabled state handling
- TypeScript prop interface with React.ButtonHTMLAttributes extension

**Card Component** (`src/components/card.tsx`)

- Optional title prop with conditional rendering
- Children content support with React.ReactNode
- Custom className merging with default styles
- Responsive design with Tailwind utilities

**Build Configuration** (`tsup.config.ts`)

- Dual ESM/CJS output with React JSX preservation
- Individual entry points for tree-shaking optimization
- TypeScript declaration generation
- Source map support for development

**Testing Setup** (`vitest.config.ts`, `tests/setup.ts`)

- Vitest configuration with React Testing Library
- jsdom environment for DOM simulation
- Custom render utilities for component testing

### Current Capabilities

- **React Component Development**: Full TypeScript support with React patterns
- **Bundle Optimization**: Tree-shaking friendly exports for minimal impact
- **Styling Integration**: Tailwind CSS with component library scanning
- **Peer Dependency Management**: Runtime validation and helpful error messages
- **Testing Infrastructure**: React Testing Library with comprehensive test utilities
- **Build Flexibility**: Multiple output formats for different consumption patterns
- **Development Experience**: Hot reloading, TypeScript checking, and linting

## Future Directions

### High Priority

1. **Component Library Expansion**

   - Add Input, Select, Modal, and other common components
   - Implement consistent component API patterns
   - Create component composition guidelines

2. **Accessibility Enhancement**

   - Implement focus management patterns
   - Create accessibility testing utilities

3. **Advanced Styling**
   - Dynamic theme system beyond static Tailwind classes
   - CSS-in-JS integration options
   - Component variant system expansion

### Medium Priority

4. **Developer Experience**

   - Storybook integration for component documentation
   - Visual regression testing setup
   - Component development playground

5. **Build Optimization**

   - Bundle size analysis and reporting
   - Advanced tree-shaking optimizations
   - CSS extraction and optimization

6. **Framework Integrations**
   - Next.js optimization and SSR support
   - Vite plugin for development workflow
   - Create React App compatibility

### Low Priority

7. **Advanced Features**
   - Headless component patterns
   - Advanced animation and transition support
   - Component performance monitoring

## Success Criteria

- ‚úÖ Production-ready React component library template
- ‚úÖ Optimal bundle sizes with tree-shaking support
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive TypeScript support with React patterns
- ‚úÖ Proper peer dependency management
- ‚úÖ Testing infrastructure for React components
- ‚úÖ Tailwind CSS integration with library scanning
- ‚úÖ Development toolchain for React development
- üöß Component library expansion with common UI patterns
- üöß Accessibility compliance and testing
- ‚è≥ Community adoption and feedback integration

## Getting Involved

The React Example Package project welcomes contributions in these areas:

- **Component Development**: Building additional React components with consistent APIs
- **Accessibility**: ARIA implementation and accessibility testing
- **Build Optimization**: Bundle size reduction and tree-shaking improvements
- **Documentation**: Component usage guides and integration examples
